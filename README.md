# VRread

This is a reading helper app to be used with a cardboard mobile holder. It allows to read documents by head movement.

This project was founded as part of the ["Light Cares"](https://www.bmbf.de/de/light-cares-wettbewerb-zehn-projekte-ausgezeichnet-3269.html) competion of the BMBF (Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung und 
Forschung).
One part of this project was to design a casing for mobile phones. The 
best cases are available as STL files from [rioprinto.com](http://www.rioprinto.com/3d-druck-events.html).
